## The mission

The boss of the account team Mister Ranu in the Cogip company needs to have access to a DB which will reference all invoices made in the Cogip company, all contacts linked to the transactions, the company, the type of company which had a transaction with Cogip.

The goal is to create a system for the super user which will have access to all CRUD actions, the normal user which will have the possibility to CR actions and another access for the normal user which will only have the access to the R action. 10 Days to make this project.
